# NoIDEHackathon

## What's Here? ##
The repository name is somewhat a misnomer, in that the IDE was the *only* software available for the hackathon - see the rules below.

In this repo:
- A web-browser
- A webserver, sort of MVC-based
- A chat client that interfaces with the webserver

## Hackathon Rules ##

### The IDE-only hackathon ###

The only software you’re allowed to use is basic OS functions, an IDE and software you write yourself (as a group). (and GIT if you’re using source control, but you can only access repos you’ve created yourself)

No services: eg dropbox, google drive, file sharing sites etc - you want it, you build it

If working as a group, everyone at the end of the hackathon must be running everyone’s software on their own computer. Alternatively - everyone competes to make the most useable computer. Be that in quality or quantity of applications.

**Software ideas:**

- Command Prompt/Terminal/Powershell replacement
- Web browser
- Text editor - word/notepad/notepad++ replacement
- Calculator
- Instant messenger/VOIP
- Replacement IDE
- Social media clients
- MS Office Suite?!!?
- Music Player
- Video Player
- Email client
- Servers - HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP, etc

**Hard modes:**
- Write each piece of software in a different language!

- Limited namespaces/libraries/equivalent - anything outside of those namespaces etc you have to write yourself (this could be very difficult).

- No spoken communication until you can talk via the computer. All communication is either written/drawn/typed etc but still within the base rule constraints. This might work well for a long-term game in which group participants start with letters to explain how they’re going to communicate via PC. (Whether or not printing, for example, source code should be allowed is up for debate).
